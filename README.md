## Hi there 🙋🏻

- 👨‍💻 I'm Pedro Almeida from Brazil, a 20-year-old B.Sc. student majoring in Computer Engineering at the Federal University of Brasília. Currently, I'm working as a Data Scientist Intern at Mundiale. In this role, I assist in analyzing and interpreting datasets to extract valuable insights. I collaborate with multidisciplinary teams to identify and implement data process improvements. Additionally, I contribute to the development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for analyzing textual data, and another models for business cases such as propensity to buy and sales time series forecasting. My responsibilities extend to supporting the team in critically analyzing results from Machine Learning models, influencing data-driven decisions. I also execute A/B tests to validate hypotheses and optimize predictive model performance, actively participating in creating data visualizations and detailed reports.
- 🤩 My enthusiasm lies in machine learning, data science, statistics, and mathematics, and I'm constantly working on projects in these areas. Explore them in my data science portfolio below!
- 📚 My hard skills include Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels, virtual environments, Flask), SQL, Machine Learning (classification, regression, clustering, and time series), Git and Github (code versioning), and Statistics. My soft skills encompass self-directed learning, effective communication, teamwork, quick adaptability, enthusiasm, and a results-oriented approach.
