## Main data science projects
Below I describe the main data science projects I developed until the present moment. These projects represent an end-to-end framework (from data collection to deploy in a Flask web app), focused on resolving the business problem, result oriented, and following as much as possible a real data science workflow. In order to achieve this, I adopt practices like virtual environment use (isolating dependencies), exception handling, loggings, documentation (every script/function/class purposes and definitions are defined inside the files), etc. Finally, all the documentation containing the pipeline used, results and the explanation of each decision made is present in the readme files or first page.

<b>1. Credit Card Churn Prediction: </b>This is an end-to-end machine learning project (from data collection to deploy) that utilizes XGBoost to predict customer's probability of churning in a bank's credit card service. Identifying likely churners helps plan strategies for retention, maintaining healthy revenue. Acquiring a new customer is costlier than keeping one. The main objectives were: Identify the factors associated with customer churn; construct a model capable of predicting as many potential churners as possible; offer action plans for the bank to reduce credit card customer churn. Finally, it was possible to achieve an estimated gain of $198,098.82 by calculating the difference between the true positive gain, the cost of retaining false positives and the cost of false negatives churning.

<b>2. German Bank's Credit Scoring: </b>This is an end-to-end machine learning project (from data collection to deploy) that uses Random Forest to assign credit scores to potential customers of a German bank. By doing so, it can make informed decisions, protecting return on equity (ROE) while minimizing credit risk. The main objectives were: Identify the factors associated with credit risk in the form of business insights; offer suggestions for the bank to minimize credit risk in its operations; construct a model capable of accurately predicting the probability of a customer defaulting on a loan, assigning a credit score to him. In order to achieve this, ROC-AUC was the metric of interest. Moreover, I estimated financial results calculating ROE using the expected revenue from non-defaulters' loans, the expected loss from defaulters' loans, and the total credit amount lent before the solution and after changing the bank's credit policy from my credit scoring model. Finally, after extending credit only to customers with a credit score of 6 or higher, the ROE increased from 9.55% to 42.64%. Link: https://github.com/allmeidaapedro/Credit-Scoring-German-Bank

<b>3. Retail Store's Customer Segmentation and Profiling: </b> In this project, I performed an unsupervised learning clustering task using K-Means on unlabeled training data to segment and profile customers for a retail store. After segmenting the clients, a loyalty program called "Prosperous" was developed based on the profile of our best customers, the Prosperous ones. Moreover, by utilizing techniques such as dimensionality reduction and silhouette score analysis for model comparison and cluster definition, I was able to effectively segment the clientele into five groups, creating distinct personas. Finally, a financial estimate was made. The loyalty program has the potential to increase the total store revenue by 9%, amounting to $125,228.55. Therefore, the project is worthwhile.

<b>4. German Bank's Credit Risk Prediction: </b> This is an end to end machine learning project (from data collection to deploy) using Random Forest to predict credit risk of German Bank's customers. By employing predictive models, the bank can make informed decisions that balance profit generation with prudent risk management, ultimately benefiting both the institution and its customers. In this project, I focused more on showing technical skills rather than business problem. The business problem for this case is strictly followed in project 2. Here, I intended to focus on recall metric, balancing the precision-recall trade-off and making predictions by comparing the model's estimated probabilities of being bad risk with a threshold that was selected from this trade-off.

<b>5. Walmart's Sales Prediction: </b> This is a machine learning project using LightGBM to predict Walmart weekly sales. It is a supervised learning regression task. Predicting sales will offer numerous benefits and useful applications for Walmart, such as inventory management, resource allocation, supply chain efficiency, promotion and pricing strategies, waste reduction, etc. Link: https://github.com/allmeidaapedro/Walmart-Sales-Prediction
